#### 🚀 About Me

I specialize in incident response, threat detection, and digital forensics, with hands-on experience across SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS, and cloud security. My approach is rooted in driving measurable improvements-reducing false positives, accelerating response times, and integrating automation to streamline security operations. I’m passionate about leveraging frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain to proactively defend digital environments and communicate complex findings clearly to all stakeholders.
